# Interactive & Internet Enabled Media
## Websites, generative art, interactive installations, and more.

### Websites and user experience.
I try to design websites and interfaces whose ease of use comes from their simplicity. Clean and readable, but with depth. I've included a few samples of sites that I have designed and built.

### Marin Art and Garden Center interactive map. 
This is an interactive experience that I designed and built for [the Marin Art and Garden Center](https://magc.org/) in Ross, California in the summer of 2018. The MAGC grounds contain many notable historical places, and the non-profit was keen to showcase them to visitors. I developed a map that allows them to add locations and information with a geo and topic tagging system. 

The layout, colors, and fonts were all choosen to integrate the interactive map with MAGC's existing print and digital promotional materials.

I developed the map with the help of a survey of the grounds so that points are able to be added with their real latitude and longitude, which is then converted to screen X/Y space to display on the interactive map. This facilitates accurately and easily adding new points to the map, as well as the possibility of future features such as a GPS enabled walkthrough. 

This project also included photographing each of the 24 points of interest at the Marin Art and Garden Center. In addition to these photos, I also created the map of the grounds from the survey.

### Flight time prediction with machine learning.
This is a project that I developed in four days for [an HCI class](http://humanaiclass.org/) at CMU. I started with a dataset from the US Department of Transportation of data from every domestic flight since the late 80's. I spent the first two days [visualizing, cleaning, and developing a model from the data](https://github.com/CBR0MS/flightTimeModel/blob/master/Flight%20Time%20Modeling.ipynb), using Tensorflow. 

The next two days I spent designing and implementing the site. I trained the models offline and encoded them to json format, so they could be opened and used again on the site with Tensorflow JS. Not having an extensive backend made the website quite lightweight and able to be [hosted on Github pages](https://github.com/CBR0MS/flightTimeModel/tree/gh-pages). The interface is very simple, with one page for input and a second to display and visualize the results.
