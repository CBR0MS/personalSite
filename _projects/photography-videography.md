# Photography & Videography
## Short films and black and white digital and film photography.

### Landscapes, urban and natural.

Much of what I photograph is the urban and natural landscape. I enjoy finding patterns and compositions in the clutter of industrial areas and simple lines in the complexity of nature. 

This portfolio includes images from several personal projects. The first is a set of compositions from urban industrial areas around the Bay Area in California.

### Pinhole photographs.

I also sometimes take the opposite approach, and opt for a less analytical look at the landscape. In this project, I fit my camera with a pinhole body cap and explored the edges of the San Francisco Bay, where the mash meets the developed land.
