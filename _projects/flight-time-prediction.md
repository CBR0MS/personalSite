# Flight Time Prediction with Tensorflow and Keras.

This was a four day project I completed for the class Human AI Interaction in fall of 2018. The first two days were spent [developing the model](https://github.com/CBR0MS/flightTimeModel/blob/master/Flight%20Time%20Modeling.ipynb) and the other two days were spent designing and [implementing the website, flygeni.us](https://flygeni.us).
